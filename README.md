# Countdown Timer
This is a simple Python program that takes a user input for a number of seconds, and then counts down, second by second, until it displays a message.

## Installation

To use this program, first clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/countdown-timer.git
```

## Usage

Run the program by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

Enter the number of seconds you want to count down from when prompted.

The program will then count down, displaying the remaining time after each second, until the countdown is complete and a message is displayed.

## Dependencies

This program uses the time module from the Python standard library to pause for 1-second intervals during the countdown. No additional dependencies are required.
